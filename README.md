# FHIR Authorization Service Accelerator

This accelerator can be used to get the basic patient and privilege user based authorization policies for FHIR APIs.

A component in Choreo can be created by pointing the Authorization Service accelerator's [authz-service-fhir-r4-api-0.9.0](https://github.com/wso2/open-healthcare-choreo-accelerators/tree/authz-service-fhir-r4-api-0.9.0) branch. For more details on creating components using Github, please refer [https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-components-with-git/](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-components-with-git/).
