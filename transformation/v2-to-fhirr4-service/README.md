# HL7V2 to FHIR R4 Service

## Introduction

This service transforms HL7v2 messages to FHIR resources. Data transformation conditions are taken from the official HL7v2 to FHIR mappings page (https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/v2-to-fhir/) and based on the feedback received from the users.

You do not have to write code from scratch but reuse these existing services when implementing your FHIR services. You can deploy the pre-built service on your own environment or deploy on Choreo as a standard Ballerina service.

```Supported HL7v2 message versions are 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7, 2.7.1, 2.8.```

```Supported FHIR version is 4.0.1.```

## Setup and run

1.Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the pre-built service on `v2-to-fhirr4-service`.

2. Run the project.

    ```ballerina
    bal run
    ```

4. Invoke the API.

    Sample request format:

    ```
    curl 'http://<host>:<port>/transform' \
    --data-raw 'MSH|^~\&|EPIC|EPICADT|SMS|SMSADT|202211031408|CHARRIS|ADT^A01|1817457|D|2.8'
    ```

## [Optional] Deploy in Choreo
